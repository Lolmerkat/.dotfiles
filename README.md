These dotfiles have been organized, split and rewritten into:
- [**windots**](https://github.com/lolmerkat/windots): windows-specific 
- [**dotfiles**](https://github.com/lolmerkat/dotfiles): linux-specific
- [**crossdots**](https://github.com/lolmerkat/crossdots): shared

This was done to reduce useless/obsolete configuration files and switch to the conventional commit style.

 _**Original README**_:

> My personal configuration files.

> ## /utils
>
> This directory contains some (for me) important utils such as:
> - [autorun.pyw](./utils/autorun.pyw)
>
> - [notifier.py](./utils/notifier.py)
>    - This files is used to:  
>        a) check for differences from the local dotfiles to the remote repository  
>        b) send a notification showing the difference
